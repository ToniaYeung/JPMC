### JPMorgan Chase Virtual Internship

Assisted with developing an interface producing visualisations and analysis of stock price data for traders using the JPMorgan Chase framework (Perspective) with Python and React.

Used Perspective to generate a chart that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing manner for traders to monitor their trading strategy. 

Processed the data feed of two stocks to enable analysation of when trading for stock should occur. 

Took an incomplete setup of Perspective, i.e. a graph that updates manually, and modified it so that it updates automatically by continuously requesting from the server application. 

Modified the live chart to be able to (1) track and display the ratio between the two stock prices over time (2) show the historical upper and lower bounds of the stocks' ratio (3) and finally, trigger 'alerts'  whenever these bounds are crossed by the calculated ratio in a specific time period.
